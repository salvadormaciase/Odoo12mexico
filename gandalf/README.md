Monetary Revaluation - A Non-disruptive approach
================================================

This module is meant to be a different approach for monetary revaluation than
that of Mandrake. While Mandrake creates Journal Entries directly related to
the invoices and them are interwoven to them - i.e., reconciled. Gandalf's
approach pretends to be less intrusive and avoids to mess with the
reconciliation.

Note
----

Gandalf and Mandrake modules are not meant to be installed at the same time in
the same database. We advice against such an action. Support will not be
provided should it happened
